### Concept:

Created an NFT marketplace, which is an online platform to buy, list, and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and deployed it to the Goerli test network. The smart contracts were written in Solidity and the blockchain network is connected to a MetaMask wallet to interact with the marketplace.

<br>

### Back End:

The smart contract web app is powered by Ethereum Smart Contracts developed in Solidity and was deployed to the Goerli test network using Javascript. Used Pinata to upload NFT data, which includes the image and the JSON data to IPFS. 

<br>

Utilized the Hardahat development environment to build, test, and deploy our smart contracts. A MetaMask wallet is connected to the Goerli test network using an Alchemy RPC endpoint. We can get free Goerli ETH from the goerli faucet.

### Front End:

Developed a Web3 app using React.js that interacts with the Blockchain. It allows users to buy, list, and sell NFTs. The app interacts with MetaMask to validate the Smart Contracts and pay a small gas fee to buy or sell an NFT.
