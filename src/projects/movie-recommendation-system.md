### Back End:

The website employs the bag of words machine learning model to make movie recommendations based on user input in the form of content and tags consisting of movie details. It uses a 5000 movies database and the TMDB API to pull movie specifics for displaying and running the model to make comparisons.

### Front End:

Streamlit was used as the front end of the website. It displays the movie poster, synopsis, audience score, release date, cast, crew, and a brief overview of the top 10 most similars movies. The website is hosted online on the heroku platform.
