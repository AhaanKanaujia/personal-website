### Back End:

Created a simple blockchain based ToDo application powered by Ethereum Smart Contracts developed in Solidity, built using the Truffle Suite that can be deployed onto a Blockchain with migrations.  

<br>

Utilized Truffle to compile the Smart Contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Ganache as a private local blockchain to deploy the contracts and Web3 app. 

<br>

### Front End:

Developed a Web3 app using Node.js that interacts with the local Blockchain and the ToDo app. It allows users to create and complete tasks. The app interacts with MetaMask to validate the Smart Contracts and pay a small gas fee to deploy the contract onto the chain itself.
