### Concept:

A DeFi (Decentralized Finance) Dapp (Decentralized Application) that allows visitors to send Goerli as tips and leave messages. The Smart Contracts are deployed to the Goerli test network. 

<br>

### Back End:

Utilized the Hardahat development environment to build, test, and deploy our smart contracts. A MetaMask wallet is connected to the Goerli test network using an Alchemy RPC endpoint. We can get free Goerli ETH from the [goerli faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/).

<br>


### Front End:

Ethers.js is used to interact with our smart contracts deployed to the Goerli test network. Developed the front end using React.js and replit. The app can be deployed to our localhost, where users can connect their wallet and send tips to the user on the test network.
